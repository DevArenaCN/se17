Structure interview

- Initial briefing
- Permission to exclude
- Written and stated gaurentees that 
       - they will not be identified
       - at some future time, they can remove their data from your raw data collection
       - gaurentees signed, in duplicate, given to attendees, kept with student project
- One worked example
- N structured tasks (do this, try that)
- A structured debrief
       - Questions to answer,
       - Question standard for all participants
- Followed by an unstructured talk aloud session for 10 minutes
       - ideally with the participant talking much much more than than they analysts
       - So have a bunch of prompt questions "anything else you'd want to see changed?" "ever seen anything like this before",
         etc
         
60 people. 15 teams. 2 surveys in Jan and March. at least 10 per survey. 20 *2*10 = 300

5 surveys per person. 1 mark per survey. Each team will have a "secretary" who must keep a list of the students who did surveys.
