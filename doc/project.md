# Project

_"Every feature is an experiment."_   
-- Laurie Williams

_"Sure, you can code. But can you engineer?"_   
-- Tim Menzies

+ i.e.  Can you work in a team?
+ Assess technical options and rigorously defend one of them? 
+ Can you code to acceptable levels of quality? 
+ Can you save time by reusing (parts) of other people's code?
+ Do you know about configuration and version control?
+ Can you deliver enough  working software, on time, avoiding superflous details?
 
Lets find out. In this work you will:


|when|what| notes|
|----+----+-------|
|jan31|find your users|a community of people who have a problem with X|
|     |document a  **baseline**| document what problems people have with X|
|     |conduct research |look into  how other people have solved X (using software)|
|     |lightning talk| 5 minute briefing (20 slides * 30 seconds each to class on your problem) **must** include notes on your proposed solution
|feb28|propose solutions|3 **different** ways to solve X|
|     |significant progress|code demos showing the 3 solutions|
|     |evaluation plan| materials required for user eval sessions. Must include answers to [this questionnaire](https://github.com/REU-SOS/HumanStudy/blob/master/testplan.pdf).|
|mar30|results|   document your **improvement** (if any)i.e. document how people's experience changes with X|
|     |recommendations| make a reasoned recommendation; i.e. write a report that reports your 3 designs, your methods, your results, and your recommendations for which (if any) to use.|
|     | lightning talk| 10 minute briefing (20 slides * 30 seconds each+ 5 mins questions) to class on your problem)  **must** present your results and recommendations|
|apr30|software analytics| report on patterns in comments and commits in Gihub projects|

## Rules

- Teams are assign randomly. Why?
      - Cause its great to meet new people. 
      - Also,   in industry, you often get teamed with other people. Get used to it!
- Work must be submitted to 	[http://tiny.cc/givese17](http://tiny.cc/givese17)
      - Post unlinks to you pdf reports/talsk
      - Do not post raw links. Rather, use [tiny.cc](http://tiny.cc) to produce a 
        short human-readable URL; e.g. `http://tiny.cc/se17jan` could be group g's
        report for the January deliverable. Also `http://tiny.cc/se17janTalk`
        could be the talk for that deliverable.
- All your work must be in Github. 
       - Everything that someone else would need  to reproduce your work.   
       - Every group needs `timm` and `effat` as members.
- All you reports must be pdf generated from ShareLatex. Can't use Latex? Then time to learn:
 <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/instapage-user-media/cba104e6/6832348-0-screen2x.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/instapage-user-media/cba104e6/6832348-0-screen2x.png" align=right width=300></a>
     - All reports must conform to the typographical style of [Latex conference style files
of IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 
     - No deviations.
- All your presentations **must** be written in Google slides. No presie. No powerpoint. No raw pdf.
     - All talks must be click at go
     - All talks must auto advance each slide every 30 seconds. No more, no less.
  

## Red flags

- Not meeting tomorrow
     - Meet for 10 minutes tonight; prime the pumps with some intial idea
     - Meet tomorrow for an hour. Map out January, when you have to do what. Do it.
- Whole team is working on one person's pet project they ahve been nursing along for years
     - Unlikely that person will relinquish control of their baby
- Team explores 3 options, with no guiding principle. 
     - "We don't have a theory."
     - "Can't find anyone who has done anything like this before." 
     - Yeah, right...
- Group breakdown reproted to me with deadlines less than 1 week away
    - The time to fix management issues is BEFORE deadline pressure hits
- Github commits, comments are very rare, only from one person
     - "But we do pair programming, all typing together".
     - Really, all the time? Every day of the week?
- Team coding right up to the due dates
     - What? No testing phase?
     - And what about all the work that happens after coding?
- Team members do not share any code; 
     - e.g. "we are building 3 seperate systems on Windows, Mac, Android."
- Team members communicate rarely.
- Team members communicate in email or Slack, not Github
     - Makes the last project hard
- Team members never comment on each other issues in Github.
- Wierd reports
    - Reports not written in Latex
    - Reports that are very short (less than 6 pages)
    - Reports with figures not mentioned in text
    - Reports with no bibliograghies
    - Reports written by only 1 person in the project. e.g. "help me, help me, my subject mark is bad cause Tim was writing the report and he
  did a bad job". Nope. Reports are **everyone's** responsbilities
- Team's three different "versions" justs uses 3 different learners.
    - Data miners are only "different" if they offer a different user experience
    - So standard Naive Bayes and Decision tree learners are the "same"
    - But what would be different for suers is showing them the decision trees and saying
  "you landed here, you want to be there, here is the difference in the tree branches".
- Building from scratch
    - Better to eapfrog into your work by reusing some other code base.
    - For example, for anything with user input, consider the Subline Text editor. It has a
  [nifty package manager](https://packagecontrol.io/) that allows you to switch between packagages, even at runtime (makes experimentation easy).	     


### Create an Organziation in Github

One organization has many repositories.

### Use ShareLatex

Remember:  push the big blue button.

Link the sharelatex project to a repo in your organization
